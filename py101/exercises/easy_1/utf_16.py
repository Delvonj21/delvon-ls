# Write a function that determines and returns the UTF-16 string value of a string passed in as an argument. The UTF-16 string value is the sum of the UTF-16 values of every character in the string. (You may use ord to determine the UTF-16 value of a character.)

# 1.	Define a function to take a single argument (the string).
# 2.	Initialize a variable to keep track of the total UTF-16 value sum.
# 3.	Iterate over each character in the string:
# •	Convert the character to its UTF-16 value.
# •	Add this value to the running total.
# 4.	Return the total sum of UTF-16 values.
