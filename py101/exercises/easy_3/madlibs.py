# Madlibs is a simple game where you create a story template with "blanks" for words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

# Create a simple madlib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective, and injects them into a story that you create.

# Prompt for a noun 
noun = input('Enter a noun: ')
# Prompt for a verb
verb = input('Enter a verb: ')
# Prompt for an adverb
adverb = input('Enter an adverb: ')
# Prompt for an adjective
adjective = input('Enter an adjective: ')
# Create a story
# Inserts words into story
print(f"Do you {verb} your {adjective} {noun} {adverb}? That's hilarious!")
print(f"The {adjective} {noun} {verb} {adverb} over the lazy dog.")
print(f"The {noun} {adverb} {verb} up to Joe's {adjective} turtle")
